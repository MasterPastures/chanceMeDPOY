Goal: use a player's physical measurables, namely wingspan, height, and weight, to predict NBA All-Defense selections with a supervised learning model.

## Motivation
From watching expert analysts discuss the NBA, playing the NBA 2K series, and generally perusing Basketball Reference, there seems to be a general consensus that wingspan is the best predictor of defensive ability. 
However, I do not fully agree with this; I believe results will show that weight is the best indicator, followed by some permutation of wingspan and height.

For argument's sake, I am offering the measurables of two of my most effective 2K players ever (both are power forwards, so mentioning position is a moot point):

* Player 1: 6'8", 259 lbs, 7'4" wingspan
* Player 2: 6'9", 235 lbs, 7'7" wingspan

I expect the results to show more favorable outcomes for player 1.

Notes:

* The most recent full dataset I could get is dated 2021.
* The earliest wingspan measurements I can find from the NBA date back to the 2001-02 season.
* It is unclear if the ABA data is present here, as they merged leagues in 1976.
* The All-Defensive teams were first established in 1969. 180 different players in total have been named to these teams.
* I am leaving entries separate per season to see how projections vary for the same player given how unlikely it is that adult weight and height change.
